## Our Story

Founded in Sandwich, Massachusetts—the oldest town on Cape Cod (est. 1637). The brand honors our family's connection to the Cotuit Kettleers baseball team, 1995 Cape Cod Baseball League Champions.

My father spent forty years as a dentist in Sandwich. When he retired and received a FODMAP diagnosis, every store-bought rub was suddenly off-limits. So I created custom blends just for him—championship-caliber flavor without a single high-FODMAP ingredient.
